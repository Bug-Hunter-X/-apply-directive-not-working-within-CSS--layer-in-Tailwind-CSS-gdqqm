# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue within @layer

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind's `@apply` directive fails to function correctly when used inside a CSS `@layer`.  The expected behavior is that utility classes applied using `@apply` should be injected into the CSS. However, in this scenario, the classes are not being applied, resulting in the styling not being reflected.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile your Tailwind CSS (using your preferred method).
3. Observe that the styles defined using `@apply` within the `@layer` are not applied.

## Expected Behavior

The `@apply` directive should correctly apply the specified utility classes, resulting in the expected visual styling.

## Actual Behavior

The `@apply` directive within the `@layer` does not apply the utility classes, leaving the element unstyled.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.css` demonstrates a workaround to resolve this issue. This solution involves restructuring CSS rules or potentially using a different approach to apply styles. Refer to the file for details.
