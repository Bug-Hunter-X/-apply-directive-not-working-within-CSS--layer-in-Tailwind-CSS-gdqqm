The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a CSS @layer.  The `@apply` directive doesn't seem to work as expected, failing to apply the specified utility classes. This is unexpected because `@apply` is generally designed for this purpose. The problem appears to be related to the order of CSS processing, potentially with Tailwind's internal layer handling or the interaction between `@layer` and `@apply`.
